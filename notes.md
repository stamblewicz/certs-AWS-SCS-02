# Cheatsheets vs syllabus
AWS services and features 
Note: Security affects all AWS services. Many services do not appear in this list because the overall service is 
out of scope, but the security aspects of the service are in scope. For example, a candidate for this exam would 
not be asked about the steps to set up replication for an S3 bucket, but the candidate might be asked about 
configuring an S3 bucket policy.
